The price for the value provides a large return on the investment. For the free version, which works great, you can run at least 10 tasks at a time. However, these tasks are ran simultaneously in the background of the computer application. In my opinion buying any of the plans that allow you to use the cloud interface is very helpful and provides a good bit of flexibity. You can close out of the application and know that Octoparse is running on a server somewhere. My favorite feature is the multi-export options that are provided (csv, microsoft excel old & new, TXT, html). Octoparse doesn't require you to have any knowledge of coding which is helpful. However, knowing simple x-code shortcuts makes Octoparse even more powerful because you can create your own custom script that will run based on your need. The walkthrough tutorials when you first start I think is what really changes the game for Octoparse. \r\n\r\nEvery once in a while. I have issues with Octoparse shutting down or troubles exporting. However, Octoparse support is super quick and reliable. The bill payment is very trustworthy as well. Octoparse also offers proxy capabilities, and the ability to turn off images to speed up the process. Another addition in the cloud settings is the ability to denote and categorize tasks based on its status. I know this may seem like a no-brainer feature. However it is super helpful to know the status or time of when multiple tasks will be completed so I can plan the extraction.

Although the documentation could be better, I find that if I do have any questions, Mozenda support responds quickly and knowledgeably.  \n\nThe problem with the documentation is really just that it\'s hard to find how to do more advanced things.  Often the information is somewhere in a recording of a webinar, so it can take a bit of time to find it.\n\nInevitably, there are things that I need to do that require modifying the XPath definitions or working around limitations in the software.  For example, Mozenda only captures data in a flat list, so if you would like to capture lists within lists, you have to repeat a lot of data and clean it up outside the tool itself.\n\nThe good news is that the API is complete (i.e. everything that can be done in the UIs can be done in the APIs, and more).
