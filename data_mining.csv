Although the documentation could be better, I find that if I do have any questions, Mozenda support responds quickly and knowledgeably.  \n\nThe problem with the documentation is really just that it\'s hard to find how to do more advanced things.  Often the information is somewhere in a recording of a webinar, so it can take a bit of time to find it.\n\nInevitably, there are things that I need to do that require modifying the XPath definitions or working around limitations in the software.  For example, Mozenda only captures data in a flat list, so if you would like to capture lists within lists, you have to repeat a lot of data and clean it up outside the tool itself.\n\nThe good news is that the API is complete (i.e. everything that can be done in the UIs can be done in the APIs, and more).  The API documentation is mostly clear, but sometimes I do need to experiment to make sure I understand exactly what it returns.\n\nOverall, I would recommend Mozenda to people who are looking for a faster alternative to coding their own webscrapes, or to less technical people who have fairly straight-forward requirements or are willing to take the time to learn how things work a little more ""under the hood.""

I have each scraper on its own scraping schedule and each day, like clockwork, the scraper starts, performs the scraping task and then upon completion publishes my data to an Amazon web service bucket.

There are several other publishing options in addition to Amazon, including FTP, email,  as well as storage in the Mozenda cloud. \n\nOne feature that distinguishes Mozenda from its competitors is it customer support. I  have participated in numerous goto-meeting sessions with Mozenda's support team working on a complex scraping agent or improving the processing efficiency of an existing agent.    The support team is knowledgeable, willing to take the time to teach you  and even available on Saturdays.  \n\nMozenda can also scrape PDF files which is also something some of its competitors can't do. \n\nI've been very happy with Mozenda and would recommend you give it a try.""}], [{'Jon P.': ['Partner', 'Information Technology and Services, 1-10 employees', 'Used the software for: 6-12 months']}, [{'Overall': '4/5'}, {'Ease of Use': '3/5'}, {'Customer Service': '4/5'}, {'Features': '5/5'}, {' Value for Money': '4/5'}], 'November 8, 2016', {'review heading': '“Does what it should, reliably and smoothly”', 'Overall': ""As is always the way these days, I'm measuring my satisfaction in terms of what has (or in this case hasn't) gone wrong.  \nIt took a little bit of learning and tweaking to get things running but, starting as an absolute novice, I've now got Mozenda capturing my data, uploading to AWS, running daily and without issue.
