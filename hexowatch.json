There's even an API so you can connect to Zapier, Pabbly Connect, etc to run automations when a webpage change is detected.

But there are some room for improvement when it comes to UI/UX. One example is that when you add a new URL to monitor and are going to tag it and an appropiate tag doesn't exist so you need to create a new tag. By doing that you'll get transfered to another page to create the tag and you then have to start over by opening the \"Add URL\"-page, enter the URL again and then you can choose your new tag.
